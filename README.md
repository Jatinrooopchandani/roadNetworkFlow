Road Network Flow is a project designed to simulate and analyze flow in a road network. This project leverages algorithms and techniques to solve network flow problems, optimize traffic, and improve the efficiency of transportation systems.  

## Features  
- Simulation of road networks with nodes and edges.  
- Implementation of flow optimization algorithms.  
- Visualization of traffic patterns and flow distribution.  
- Analysis of bottlenecks and optimal paths in the network.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Algorithms:** Network flow optimization, shortest path algorithms, etc.  
- **Libraries/Tools:** SDL 

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/nghack3000/roadNetworkFlow.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd roadNetworkFlow  
   ```  
3. Build/Run the project:  
   - **For C++ Projects:**  
     ```bash  
     g++ -o roadNetworkFlow main.cpp  
     ./roadNetworkFlow  
     ```  
   - **For Python Projects:**  
     ```bash  
     python main.py  
     ```  

## Usage  
1. Add road network data by defining nodes and edges in the input file.  
2. Run the simulation to calculate the flow distribution.  
3. Analyze the output for bottlenecks and optimal routing suggestions.  

## Example  
```  
Input:  
Node A -> Node B: Capacity = 10  
Node B -> Node C: Capacity = 15  

Output:  
Optimal flow from A to C: 10  
Bottleneck: Node B  
```  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add dynamic road network updates.  
- Integrate with a UI for better visualization.  
- Implement real-world datasets for practical applications.
