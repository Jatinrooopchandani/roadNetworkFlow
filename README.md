Road Network Flow is a project designed to simulate and analyze flow in a road network. This project leverages algorithms and techniques to solve network flow problems, optimize traffic, and improve the efficiency of transportation systems.  

## Features  
- Simulation of road networks with nodes and edges.  
- Implementation of flow optimization algorithms.  
- Visualization of traffic patterns and flow distribution.  
- Analysis of bottlenecks and optimal paths in the network.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Algorithms:** Network flow optimization, shortest path algorithms, etc.  
- **Libraries/Tools:** SDL 

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/nghack3000/roadNetworkFlow.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd roadNetworkFlow  
   ```  
3. Build/Run the project:  
   - **For C++ Projects:**
